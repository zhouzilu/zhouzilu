### Zilu Zhou
Iâ€™m currently a Senior Data Scientist working at Google. My works focus on statistical modeling and inference, in the context of model AB testing and causal inference.
Previously, I received my Ph.D degree in Genomics and Computational Biology and M.A. in Statistics from University of Pennsylvania. My Ph.D thesis is Statistical Methods For Multi-Omics Inference From Single Cell Transcriptome.
